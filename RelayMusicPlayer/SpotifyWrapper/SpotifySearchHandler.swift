    //    By default, results are returned when a match is found in any field of the target object type.
    //    Searches can be made more specific by specifying an album, artist or track field filter.
    //    For example, the query q=album:gold%20artist:abba&type=album will only return albums with the text "gold" in the album name and the text "abba" in the artist's name.
    // ** This may be useful later on. I doubt many spotify users know about these features. They can currently use them just by typing them, though we may need to use them somewhere other than the search (or make these features more obvious in the search)
